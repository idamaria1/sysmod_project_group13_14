I didn't really take specific notes on what I worked on , but I have tried to write down the hours in here approximately.
* First week (02.11 - 08.11):
  From what I can remember I didn't really do much work for the project on this week after the lab (mainly focused on previous labs), but I started familiarizing myself with the specification, so maybe about 2h of spent time.
* Second week (09.11 - 15.11):
  This week was spent on thinking about the project implementation (functionalities I wanted to see), refining user stories and creating tasks, friday meeting. 9h in total.
* Third week (16.11 - 22.11):
  Finished creating tasks, spent answering thinking about and answering questions from team members, friday meeting - 3h.  
* Fourth week (23.11 - 29.11):
  Teammate questions, helping them, having a look at the first frontend and backend implementation. Implemented notification system - 5h.
* Fifth week (30.11 - 06.12):
  Don't remember much about this week, but we still had the friday meeting and had to answer questions from the team mates, so probably around 1-3h.
* Sixth week (07.12 - 13.12):
  This was the busiest week for me. About 10-11h spent working on the sanity check of the implementation, adding currency stuff, fixing other problems. And we also had the friday meeting.
* Seventh week (14.12 - 15.12):
  The ideas and coding aprt had been done in the previous weeks, only the presentation remained. Spent 2h on doing my recording for the presentation.

17.11.2020, 2h 30m. Planned upcoming work, decided to start reading ASP.NET Core documentation, Googling occasionally if needed and found some other tutorials to use later as well. Attempted to create basic initial models, which I commited the next day.

19.11.2020, 2h. Continued reading about ASP.NET, need to figure out how the bloody thing works. Am I crazy for taking the architecture owner role knowing almost nothing of ASP.NET or web development? TBD

20.11.2020, 6h 30m. Continued reading, thought about models. Wrote down questions for myself, made some decisions about models. Later found out that ASP.NET takes care of many things for us since it already has classes for Users and Roles. Implemented Lauri's suggestions on the class models - thanks, Lauri!

24.11.2020, 4h 20m. Reflected on the model and looked at Issue list and our discussion to see what fields could be needed and if they already exist in the model or not. By the end of the day I had finally finished the most important parts of the ASP.NET documentation and one long-ish, but useful tutorial. Code is no longer in Chinese, but many design decisions are still unclear - what will ASP.NET do for us and what we have to do ourselves?

27.11, 4h. Tried to write down lessons learned from the long readings and see where I could implement the things I learned. Thought about what 'good design' decisions we already have covered, which design patterns we are using and whether we should do something more (or does using ASP.NET well already cover many good design aspects). Prepared some questions for Einar, which he thoroughly answered, eliminating some confusions that I had. 

29.11, 5h 30m. Worked on creating readable and informative class diagrams and DB schema. Later saw that we had new committs and need to revisit models to look out for model-code gap. Feel that there are many questions still up, but some models need to be uploaded so work can continue; they can be revisited later.

(Lost my notes on tracked time before 23.11, sorry... Time was spent on thinking the project through, trying to coordinate the work in the frontend team, checking that everyone understood what they were doing and everyone had been assigned to eithr frontend or backend team etc)
24.11 - 2h discussion during the lab, reading about technologies we use in the project, reading through the issues<br>
25.11 - 3h front end team discussion, creating wireframes for the pages, checking that the pages meet all the requirements from the issues<br>
26.11 - 3-4h front end team discussion, wireframes, small corrections or specifications about the issues and design, trying to improve communication in frontend team, finding questions to adress in team meeting<br>
27.11 - 2-3h team meeting, discussing the results of the meeting (mainly with front end team), helping with frontend development, checking if people have been assigning issues to themselves and closing them when tasks are done
29.11 - 1.5h bringing structure in frontend team work - helping the developer understand what pages still need to be done and what info should be on which page, closing the issues that need to be closed etc, reminding people to assign issues to themselves and close them accordingly, talking to a teammember who hasn't been participating very much, reading through the issues again to make sure they don't need changing<br>
30.11 - 3h failing at html+css :D 
01.12 - 15min team meeting + 30min frontend team meeting + 4h learning html+css, failing at it a bit less than yesterday and finally also developing a page! Way too much time spent on trying to understand why the page footer keeps disappearing or randomly floating in the middle of the page...
