(Lost my notes on tracked time before 23.11, sorry... Time was spent on thinking the project through, trying to coordinate the work in the frontend team, checking that everyone understood what they were doing and everyone had been assigned to eithr frontend or backend team etc)
24.11 - 2h (discussion during the lab, reading about technologies we use in the project, reading through the issues)<br>
25.11 3-4h (front end team discussion, creating wireframes for the pages, checking that the pages meet all the requirements from the issues)<br>
26.11 - 3-4h (front end team discussion, wireframes, small corrections or specifications about the issues and design, trying to improve communication in frontend team, finding questions to adress in team meeting)<br>
27.11 - 2-3h (team meeting, discussing the results of the meeting (mainly with front end team), helping with frontend development, checking if people have been assigning issues to themselves and closing them when tasks are done)
26.11 - 1-2h (bringing structure in frontend team work - helping the developer understand what pages still need to be done and what info should be on which page, closing the issues that need to be closed etc, reminding people to assign issues to themselves and close them accordingly, talking to a teammember who hasn't been participating very much, reading through the issues again to make sure they don't need changing)<br>
30.11 - 3h (failing at html+css :D )
